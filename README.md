# Fish-Tac-Toe

#### Like Ordinary Tic-Tac-Toe, But With Fish!


## Overview

* Fish-Tac-Toe is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game, where your game pieces are.....you guessed it, FISH!
 The game is made for two players so grab a friend and play a couple games of Fish-Tac-Toe!
 Your win count will be automatically updated after each win, and the game board will reset itself
 automatically 5 seconds after the game is either won or drawn.

## Set-up

* Create a repository and clone it to your local computer
* Open it in your text editor
* Read the `README.md`
* In the terminal run the command `open index.html` for initial deployment and interaction with app

## Road Map

##### Future Iterations Should Include:

* A display of each winning game board.
* The ability for the players to choose their own FISH.
* The ability for players to set a score limit that they would like to play to before wins auto reset.
* The ability to undo and redo previous moves.
